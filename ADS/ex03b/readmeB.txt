    
     Exercise 3b: Binary Trees and their traversals

Deadline:  04/03/2013 (09:00)
Purpose: to gain experience in traversals of binary trees

1. Make a directory and down load the files in this directory (you are here)

2. Modify the file BinTree.java to implement the methods marked IMPLEMENT ME
   The methods above are already given in a "stubby" form and you must implement them.

3. Test your methods by running test program called Test from the command line

      > javac *.java
      > java Test cats00.txt
      > java Test eqn00.txt

4. Consider this ... in the data set eqn00.txt what do each of the traversals mean?
   Consider this ... in the cats00.txt do the different traversals have any significance?

5. When you are satisfied with your work, submit your file BinTree.java via MOODLE


Hints and Tips
 - Have a look at the tree inputted via the draw command. This will give insight
 - When coding up bfs you might consider using a secondary data structure such as a queue
   or a linked list (used fifo).
 - Have a look at cats00.txt (a small species tree) and eqn00.txt (an algebraic equation).
   Try and produce some of your own data sets (spaces ARE significant!).
