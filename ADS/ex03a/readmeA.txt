    
     Exercise 3a: Linked Lists and Recursive Programming

Deadline:  04/03/2013 (09:00)
Purpose: to gain experience in recursive programming, and the "pure" list

1. Make a directory and down load the files in this directory (you are here)

2. Modify the file List.java to implement the methods marked IMPLEMENT ME
    The methods above are already given in a "stubby" form and you must
    implement them.

3. Test your methods by running test program called Test from the command line

      > javac *.java
      > java Test

   NOTE: Test uses 3 lists: L, LL[0], LL[1] with the current list being L
         The swap command swaps the current list such that L = LL[1 - swap]
         The append command appends LL[0] and LL[1] such that L = append(LL[0],LL[1])
         The random (rand) command generate a new random list with elements in the range 0 to 9

4. When you are satisfied with your work, submit your file List.java via MOODLE
    and proceed to the second part (in ex03 readmeB.txt)
